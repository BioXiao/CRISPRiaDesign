# CRISPRiaDesign

This site hosts the sgRNA machine learning scripts used to generate the Weissman lab's next-generation CRISPRi and CRISPRa library designs [(Horlbeck et al., eLife 2016)](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e19760). See the included example notebook (as Jupyter notebook or [web page](Library_Design_example_notebook.html)) for example code for de novo machine learning, prediction of sgRNA activity for desired loci, and construction of new genome-scale CRISPRi/a libraries. Immediate-term plans include adding supporting data files along with a full-scale walk-through of library design. Longer-term plans include streamlining code and adding command line functions to make library design more user-friendly.
